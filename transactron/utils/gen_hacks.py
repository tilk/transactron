    # Vivado stopped inferring transparent memory ports emitted with Yosys Verilog backend
    # correctly from (probably) version 2023.1, printing [Synth 8-6430] warning.
    # It is a Vivado bug, generating circuit behaviour that doesn't match the RTL.
    # It is fixed by adding Vivado-specific RTL attribute to main memory declarations that
    # use this pattern.
    # Adds the attribute to all memories with enabled port transparency, needed until (and if)
    # Yosys changes the generated pattern.
